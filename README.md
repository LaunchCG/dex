Pipa
====
Pipa is a universal package manager for AI-augmented development tools (e.g. Claude Code, Cursor, etc)
that provides a standardized way to define, distribute, and install capabilities across multiple AI
agent platforms.


### Core Principles

- **Write Once, Deploy Everywhere**: Plugins are defined in a platform-agnostic format
- **Non-Prescriptive**: Authors declare components; adapters handle platform specifics
- **Composable**: Plugins can depend on and reference other plugins
- **Extensible**: Support for scripts, configs, MCP servers, and arbitrary files
- **Context-Aware**: Templating engine for platform and environment-specific variations
